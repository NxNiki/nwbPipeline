# Script Name: runbatch_spikeSorting.sh
# Description: submit matlab batch jobs to SGE 
# Usage: qsub ./runbatch_spikeSorting.sh
# Parameters:
#   - expName: str, This should be consistent to the file path in unpacked data.
#   - patientId: str, This should be consistent to the file path in unpacked data.
#   - expIds: matlab array, Define experiments to run spike sorting at line 78.
#   - skipExists: 1 by 3 logical matlab array, whether to skip: spikeDetection, spikeCode, spikeClustering.
#   - mode: str, 'spikeSorting' or 'extractLFP', Select the operation mode.
# =========================================


## Set the SGE parameters (#$ is not a comment, and will be processed before the shell variables are evaluated)
#$ -cwd
# Use the current working directory for the job execution

#$ -o $HOME/sgelog/job-$JOB_ID/task_$TASK_ID.txt
# Redirect the standard output and standard error to a specific file
# $JOB_ID and $TASK_ID are environment variables provided by the scheduler
# created before job execution (in submission).
# It will be same as $SGE_TASK_ID, which is created in job execution

#$ -j y
# Merge standard error with the job log (standard output)

#$ -l h_rt=10:00:00,h_data=50G
# Request resources: hours of runtime (h_rt) and memory (h_data)
# Data limit applies to each task individually, no need to change if submit more tasks.
# 20G for spike sort, 50G for lfp extraction. single thread

#$ -pe shared 1
# Request N core in a shared parallel environment. Adjust memory request (h_data) and change
# maxThreads (at line 56) if you require more cores.

# Email address to notify
#$ -M $USER@mail
# Set the email address to notify. $USER is an environment variable for the username

# #$ -m bea
# Uncomment to receive email notifications at the beginning (b), end (e), and if the job is aborted (a)

#$ -t 1:15:1
# Array job specification: run tasks with IDs from 1 to N, with a step of 1 (i.e., 1, 2, 3, ..., N)
# Each task will have a unique $SGE_TASK_ID


## Set the experiment parameters ==========
expName="MovieParadigm"
patientId="570"
expIds="[4:7]" 
runRemovePLI="1"
runCAR="1"
# if expIds is updated, do not skipExist any steps so that threshold for spike detection is same across experiments
# skipExist="[0, 0, 0]"  # [spike detection, spike code, spike clustering]
# mode="spikeSorting"  # Change to "extractLFP" to run extractLFP
skipExist="[0, 0]"  # [micro, macro]
mode="extractLFP"  # Change to "extractLFP" to run extractLFP
maxThreads="1"

## load the job environment:
. /u/local/Modules/default/init/modules.sh
# To see which versions of matlab are available use: module av matlab
module load matlab/R2023b
